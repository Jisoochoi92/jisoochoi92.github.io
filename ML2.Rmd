### 1. Objectives

+ In healthcare industry, it is always challenging to predict insurance cost accurately because of uncertainty and complexity of insurance plans.

+ The objective of this project is to predict the insurance charges based on the given demographic and health information of individuals.

+ This project aims to investigate the relationship between various patient characteristics and medical costs using multiple linear regression with forward/backward feature selection, as well as incorporating regularization methods such as Ridge regression, LASSO regression, and Elastic Net (with a ratio of 0.5). Additionally, a neural network approach was employed to explore the predict the outcome variable. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared, Root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).
