### 3. Sentiment Analysis

+ After analyzing a sample of approximately 6,000 records collected to date, we have observed that the net positive score is 37% and the net negative score is 25%.
+ This is calculated by dividing the total number of positive or negative tweets by the total number of tweets. 
+ We also assessed the model's performance on a sample of 200 records that were labeled manually. Our analysis shows that the model's accuracy is 76%. The precision and recall scores, which are calculated using macro averages, are both around 75% and 78%.
